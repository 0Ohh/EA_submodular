A. General information:

This package includes the python code of the EAMC algorithm [1].

[1] An Efficient Evolutionary Algorithm for Subset Selection with General Cost Constraints.
In: Proceedings of the 34th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI'20), New York, NY, 2020.


*************************************************************
algorithm.py: It contains the implementation of the EAMC, POMC, and generalized greedy algorithm, named EAMC, POMC, Greedy, respectively. To apply them to some concrete problems, the users need to rewrite the function "FS" and the function "CS", i.e., the objective function and the cost function.

The folder "example" contains three applications of our algorithms:

MC corresponds to the application of maximum coverage, which contains two datasets, "frb30-15-1" and "frb35-17-1". For random constraints, the generated random costs in our experiments are provided.

IM corresponds to the application of influence maximization, which contains two datasets, "graph100" and "graph200". For outdegree constraints, the parameters "\xi" randomly generated from the normal distribution N(0,0.5*0.5) are provided. For random constraints, the generated random costs in our experiments are provided.

SP corresponds to the application of sensor placement, which contains two datasets, "Beijing" and "Berkeley". The processed datasets and the generated random cost of each node in our experiments are provided.

All the examples can be run directly based on python 2.7 or python 3.0.
